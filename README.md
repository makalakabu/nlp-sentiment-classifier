# Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews ðŸŽ¬
This project implements a basic sentiment classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in Python. The goal is to distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews from the NLTK `movie_reviews` corpus. It uses tokenization, stopword filtering, and feature extraction to build a classification model.


## Project Objectives

- Explore NLP techniques to classify text sentiment
- Preprocess and tokenize raw movie review data
- Use NLTK to extract features from text
- Train and evaluate a sentiment classification model
- Understand performance implications of different NLP methods


## Techniques Used

- Tokenization using `nltk.word_tokenize`
- Stopword removal with NLTK's `stopwords`
- Feature engineering from review word frequencies
- Custom train/test split based on candidate number
- Classifier evaluation with accuracy and sample outputs


## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- pandas, matplotlib

## Sample Output

- Sentiment classification accuracy on the test set
- List of most informative words
- Examples of classified reviews
